# Optimized-EWMA

This project aims to convert statistical method, i.e, Exponential Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) of time series forecasting into a swarm intelligence method by using metaheuristic techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm(GSA) and Genetic Algorithm(GA). 

//Data
There are several time series datasets available in this folder on which results of experiment are tested.

//Code
In the ewma.py file, PSO, GSA & GA are used to find value of parameters of EWMA such that error will be minimum. Moreover, EWMA is implemented by considering these values of parameters and finally metaheuristic techniques are compared.

//Other Existing Methods
In this folder, existing methods of time series forecasting such as Double Smooting, Holt-Winter Additive & Holt-Winter Multiplicative are compared with EWMA best metaheuristic technique.
